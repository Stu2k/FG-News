    <h1>BREAKING: Newham Bans Cars, Cats, and Cutlery</h1>
    <p><em>By East End Observer & Occasional Sausage Roll Reviewer, Stuart “Woke-but-Wary” Templeton</em></p>

    <h2>🚗 Car-Free Newham Initiative</h2>
    <p>The car ban came into effect at 5am this morning. Every vehicle was towed by bicycles pulling reinforced oat-milk-powered trailers.  
    “It’s honestly a spiritual cleanse,” said <strong>Ash Wildroot</strong>, a 27-year-old barista/candlemaker. “Now I can skateboard to my foraging circles without inhaling diesel.”</p>
    <p>LTNs will now be enforced by emotionally sensitive drones that deploy haikus and biodegradable glitter bombs. "The LTNs will save all,” reads the borough mural.</p>

    <h2>🐱 Total Cat Ban Announced</h2>
    <p>Domestic cats have been banned after “rising tensions with foxes.” A <strong>Cat Amnesty Bin</strong> will be installed outside Stratford Centre. Residents are asked to deposit cats with a poem, softly and lovingly, by Thursday.</p>

    <h2>🦊 Foxes Are the New Pets</h2>
    <p>Foxes have been reclassified as companion animals. Recommended names: Gary, Snuffles, or Michael Gove.  
    <strong>How to tame:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Leave a trail of Richmond sausages</li>
        <li>Offer a name</li>
        <li>Do not attempt jumpers. You will lose a toe.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>🔪 Knife Ban in Forest Gate, Spoons Rise</h2>
    <p>All knives are banned. “Spoons are round, peaceful, and emotionally safe,” says Councillor Donna Pease-Breeze.  
    A borough-wide spoon training course starts next week. Chopsticks remain under investigation.</p>

    <h2>🔥 Chaos on Wanstead Flats</h2>
    <p>Two men — <strong>See You</strong> and <strong>Next Tuesday</strong> — fled a BBQ fire after a missing cat triggered a full fire engine response. They were stopped by <strong>The Hunter</strong>, a mysterious figure in wellies and a compostable balaclava.</p>

    <h2>🪜 Laddermania 2025 & The Forest Gate Dads</h2>
    <p>Shoutout to the <strong>FG Dads with Ladders</strong> group for incredible ladder reviews and their new slogan:  
    <strong>“LADDERS UP, NEWHAM!”</strong>  
    Special thanks to Colin T. for the Werner Fibreglass and Steve B. for wise hinge-based trust advice. A statue is being built near Upton Park KFC.</p>
